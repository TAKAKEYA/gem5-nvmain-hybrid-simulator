# gem5-nvmain-hybrid-simulator
1. DRAM-NVM Hybrid-Simulator
-----------------------------
### 1.1 Full System Simultor : gem5
* Home Page of Simulator：http://www.gem5.org/Main_Page

### 1.2 Memory System Simulator: NVMain
* Home Page of Simulator: http://wiki.nvmain.org/

### 1.3 how to attach nvmain with gem5
        (1) environment requirement
* python version < 3.0
* scons >= 0.98.1
* gcc >= 4.6.0;

(2) compile gem5 with nvmain (patch file can be found in gem5-stable/final_patch/nvmain-classic-gem5-9850)
* patch gem5 with nvmain patch file : patch -p1 < final_patch/nvmain-classic-gem5-9850
* compile with scons : scons EXTRAS=nvmain-path -jn (n represents compiling threads num)

        (3) run system with nvmain memory
* you can refer to example in directory rapp-test/gcc:--mem-type=nvmain --nvmain-config=nvmain-config-file-path


2. Cache Optimization Module in gem5-nvmain-hybrid-simulator
--------------------------------
    （1）Architecture and Principle of Cache Optimization in DRAM-PCM hybrid memory 
![principle of cache optimization](https://raw.github.com/cyjseagull/gem5-nvmain-hybrid-simulator/master/images/cache-optimization.png)
* adjust cache replacement policy according to cache miss penalty in DRAM-PCM hybrid memory system , for example: evict data block in LLC cache which fetched from PCM is expensive than data block fetched from DRAM . When evicting cache block from LLC cache , evict data block from DRAM first;
* recalculate cache replacement priority according to penalty of cache miss in memory system and reuse probability of cache block;

3. Rank-Based-Page-Placement Module in hybrid simulator implemented by multi-level-queue
--------------------------------
        （1）Principle of Rank-Based-Page-Placement Strategy
![principle of Rank-Based-Page-Placement](https://raw.github.com/cyjseagull/gem5-nvmain-hybrid-simulator/master/images/MultiQue.PNG)
* classfy memory pages into hot-pages and cold-pages according to access time;
* page access information is managed by multi-level-queue;


        （2）related source code
* nvmain/Utils/MultiQueMigrator/
* Decoders/Migrator/
* configuration file example: Config/Hybrid_example.config
* simple example scripts running CPU SPEC2006 benchmarks are placed in directory: gem5-stable/rapp-test
